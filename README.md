# System Management Subsystem for a Healthcare Platform

Here’s a structured breakdown of how to develop the Survey Management Subsystem for a cloud-native healthcare platform. This breakdown includes modular stages, architecture guidance, AI tooling, and concrete implementation steps.

## 🔧 Overview of the Subsystem

### 🎯 System Goals

- **Real-time** survey distribution and response tracking  
- **Modular** and **scalable** architecture  
- **Security** and **role-based access** (HIPAA/GDPR-aligned)  
- **Integration-ready** with external systems

## 💡 5. Key Decisions

### 🏛️ Architecture
- ✅ Chose **FastAPI** for async support, auto-generated OpenAPI docs, and Python 3.11+ compatibility.  
- ✅ **SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL** for structured relational data.  
- ✅ **Pydantic models** for request/response validation.

### ⏱️ Scheduling
- ⏳ Used **APScheduler** for background tasks (e.g., cleanup jobs).

### 📊 Analytics
- 📊 Integrated **Prometheus** for endpoint metrics (`/metrics`).

### 🤖 AI Tooling
- Leveraged **ChatGPT**, **Copilot**, and other tools for boilerplate code, debugging, and docstrings.

## Complete Survey Creation Workflow Test - Health Survey API 

### 1. Register a New User

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/users/register" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "surveyadmin@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "full_name": "Survey Admin",
    "role": "healthcare_admin"
}'
```
### 2. Login to Get Access Token
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"surveyadmin@example.com","password":"securepassword123"}' | jq -r '.access_token')

echo "Your access token: $TOKEN"
```
### 3. Create a New Survey
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/surveys" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "title": "Patient Satisfaction Survey",
    "description": "Please rate your recent healthcare experience",
    "questions": [
        {
            "id": "q1",
            "type": "rating",
            "text": "How would you rate your overall experience?",
            "required": true,
            "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
        },
        {
            "id": "q2",
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Any additional comments?",
            "required": false
        }
    ],
    "department": "cardiology",
    "expiry_days": 30
}'
```
### 4. Verify Survey Creation
```bash
# List all surveys
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/surveys" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get specific survey (replace :id with actual survey ID from the response)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/surveys/1" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
Expected Successful Responses
Registration
```json
{
  "email": "surveyadmin@example.com",
  "full_name": "Survey Admin",
  "id": 1,
  "is_active": true,
  "role": "healthcare_admin"
}
```
Login
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```
